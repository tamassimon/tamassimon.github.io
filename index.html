<p>Before ePub became a standard back in 2006 I was very excited about eInk and ebooks. I couldn't wait for the SONY Reader to be sold in North America - as it was already being sold in Japan.</p>
<p>I thought the ebook business would play out similarly to the music business and a couple of big companies would be sharing the "pie". Looking at Amazon+Kindle and Apple+iBooks I wasn't far off.<br>
I thought there would be space for an independent entity - much like the idea of eMusic in the music world who only go after 1-2% market share and offer DRM free music.<br>
I started working on some ideas and built DigitalReading.net (no longer online ) using Drupal and various add-on modules.
The google Custom Search I built to allow people to find ebooks got Google's attention: http://librariancentral.blogspot.ca/2007/02/create-google-custom-search-engine.html (also no longer online)</p>

<p>Another interest area...</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
as you know better than I do every YouTube channel is also a Miro channel.
We just need an easy way to add it to Miro.
Please have a look at a site I’ve created:
http://utube4miro.googlemashups.com/

This can be added as a Miro guide.

It will let users search for something on YouTube a then shows which YouTube “channel” has the content. (Channel on YouTube is practically a user)
It’s also one click away to see all videos from that channel.
I put “SubScribe with Miro” buttons, so it’s easy to add the channel to MIRO.

e.g. search for “Avril” and then add “RCARecords” as a new channel.

Currently it’s at Proof of Concept stage.

If there’s interest I’d be happy to share the code.

regards

keep up the good work!

<p>Meanwhile I was attending the New Ventures BC competition and the Vancouver Greentech Exchange.</p>
<p>In 2013 we teamed up with my friend Jozsef Kovacs and founded SelfHelp Corporation and entered the NVBC competition.<br>
</p>the idea was to build a mobile companion app, a sort of self-tracker / personal coach that would allow people to choose rules and principles to live by - from self-help books, philosophy, religion - and have those available on their smartphones.

<p>Focusing on the intersection of education and technology - my two passions.</p>
<p>I started by building on the wonderful work of SU alumni <a href="http://www.ideaco.org">IDEAco</a> and ran City X Project workshops in a local maker lab.<br>
The biggest limitation with CityX is that it is a single introductory session. I started working on a longer curriculum using crowd sourcing; building a community of educators, parents, students, makers.<br></p>

<p>Looking back at the over 15 years of experience both on and off work there were a couple of very nice projects where I was in <mark>flow</mark></p>
<ul>
<li>Back in the Westel days we were called &quot;special Project&quot;.</li>
<li>At Boeing while working on a new scheduling algorithm for the C17 (USAF)</li>
<li>My last project at Boeing working on a decision support system then called &quot;Enhanced Dispatch Management&quot;<br>
I could finally use what I learned about AI and expert systems!
</li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases there was good team work with extra smart people, little structure, research, working with subject matter experts and applying technology. And we were made to feel special and appreciated.</p>
<p>Is this what they call <strong>skunk works</strong>? I'd like to find one again.</p>
